## **Introduction to JavaScript**

In this section, we cover the basics of JavaScript, its importance in web development, and how it powers interactivity on modern websites.

- What is JavaScript?
- Setting up your environment
- Your first JavaScript program

---

## **DOM Manipulation**

Learn how to dynamically interact with the Document Object Model (DOM) to update content, styles, and user interactions.

- Selecting elements using JavaScript
- Modifying HTML content with `innerHTML` and `textContent`
- Handling events like clicks and form submissions

---

## **Callbacks and Higher-Order Functions**

Understand the concept of callbacks and how to use higher-order functions to manipulate behavior and flow in JavaScript.

- What is a callback?
- Creating and using higher-order functions
- Common higher-order functions like `map()`, `filter()`, and `reduce()`

---

## **Asynchronous JavaScript**

Since JavaScript is single-threaded, it uses asynchronous operations to handle multiple tasks at once. We dive into how it achieves this with the event loop and task queue.

- How JavaScript handles async tasks
- The event loop explained

---

## **Promises**

Promises make working with async operations easier and more structured. Learn how to create and chain promises for better control over asynchronous operations.

- What is a Promise?
- `.then()` and `.catch()` explained
- Chaining promises

---

## **Async/Await**

A modern, cleaner way to handle asynchronous tasks. Async/Await makes code that deals with Promises look more readable.

- The `async` keyword
- Using `await` for smoother code execution
- Error handling with `try...catch`

---

## **Fetch API**

Fetching data from a server is a core skill for any developer. In this section, we will explore how to use the Fetch API to request and receive data from remote servers.

- Introduction to the Fetch API
- Making a GET request
- Handling responses and errors

---

## **Error Handling in JavaScript**

Learn how to gracefully handle errors in your code to prevent crashes and unexpected behavior.

- `try...catch` blocks
- Throwing custom errors
- Handling asynchronous errors

---

## **Hoisting**

Understand the concept of hoisting, which allows variables and functions to be used before they are declared.

- How hoisting works for variables and functions
- The impact of `var`, `let`, and `const` on hoisting

---

## **Closures**

A closure gives you access to the variables of an outer function even after the outer function has executed.

- What is a closure?
- Examples of closures in practice
- How closures are used in real-world applications

---

## **Destructuring Arrays and Objects**

Make your code more concise and readable by using destructuring to extract values from arrays and objects.

- Destructuring arrays
- Destructuring objects
- Default values and renaming variables

---

## **Rest Parameters**

The rest parameter allows you to represent an indefinite number of arguments as an array.

- Using the rest parameter in functions
- Combining rest parameters with regular arguments

---

## **Building a Weather App**

Put your JavaScript knowledge to practical use by building a simple weather application using the Fetch API and OpenWeatherMap.

- Setting up the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files
- Fetching data from an API
- Displaying the weather data dynamically
